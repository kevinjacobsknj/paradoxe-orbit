ü§ñ **Fast, light & open-source**‚ÄîParadoxe Orbit lives on your desktop, sees what you see, listens in real time, understands your context, and turns every moment into structured knowledge.

üí¨ **Proactive in meetings**‚Äîit surfaces action items, summaries, and answers the instant you need them.

ü´•Ô∏è **Truly invisible**‚Äînever shows up in screen recordings, screenshots, or your dock; no always-on capture or hidden sharing.

## Instant Launch

‚ö°Ô∏è  Skip the setup‚Äîlaunch instantly with our ready-to-run macOS app.  [[Download Here]](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/znid09apxiwtwvxer6oc9/ParadoxeOrbit_latest.dmg?rlkey=gwvvyb3bizkl25frhs4k1zwds&st=37q31b4w&dl=1)

## Quick Start (Local Build)

### Prerequisites

First download & install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
If you are using Windows, you need to also install [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

Ensure you're using Node.js version 20.x.x to avoid build errors with native dependencies.

```bash
# Check your Node.js version
node --version

# If you need to install Node.js 20.x.x, we recommend using nvm:
# curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
# nvm install 20
# nvm use 20
```

### Installation

Navigate to the orbit directory and run setup:

```bash
cd orbit
npm run setup
```

### Environment Configuration

Paradoxe Orbit uses environment variables for secure API key management and customizable configuration. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Copy the environment template:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Configure required API keys in `.env`:**
   ```bash
   # Required for push-to-talk speech-to-text functionality
   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Optional configurations:**
   ```bash
   # Customize server ports and URLs
   PARADOXE_ORBIT_API_URL=http://localhost:9001
   PARADOXE_ORBIT_WEB_URL=http://localhost:3000
   
   # Agent daemon settings
   AGENT_DAEMON_URL=http://localhost:4823
   AGENT_HEALTH_TIMEOUT=2000
   AGENT_TASK_TIMEOUT=10000
   
   # Development/Production settings
   NODE_ENV=development
   PARADOXE_ORBIT_DEBUG=true
   PARADOXE_ORBIT_LOG_LEVEL=info
   ```

4. **Get your Deepgram API key:**
   - Sign up at [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com/)
   - Create a new API key
   - Add it to your `.env` file

5. **For macOS app notarization (optional, for distribution builds):**
   ```bash
   APPLE_ID=your_apple_developer_email
   APPLE_ID_PASSWORD=your_app_specific_password
   APPLE_TEAM_ID=your_apple_team_id
   ```

**Security Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `.env.example` file serves as a template with safe placeholder values.
